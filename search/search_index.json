[\u2026] Changing AUTH_USER_MODEL after you've created database tables is significantly more difficult [\u2026]. This change can't be done automatically and requires manually fixing your schema, moving your data from the old user table, and possibly manually reapplying some migrations. \u201d. Scary stuff. Let's just follow the advice. First, we need to create the app where we'll do everything that has to do with users. 1 ( django ) conduit$ django-admin startapp users We then change the name line in the file apps.py in the articles/ folder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 from django.apps import AppConfig class UsersConfig ( AppConfig ): default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField' name = 'conduit.users' # new Now, in users/models.py , add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser from django.db import models class User ( AbstractUser ): \"\"\"User model\"\"\" pass What we're doing here is take the AbstractUser model and save it as is. This way, we can add any modifications we need later on. In users/models.py we also need to create a Profile model: we'll explain it in more detail later, but suffice it to say that the Profile will deal with everything about our users that is not authentication (logging in and out). 1 2 3 4 class Profile ( models .

OneToOneField ( User ) Now, create a superuser in the terminal, so as to be able to access Django's admin app later on: 1 ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py createsuperuser And one last dark magic trick that you just need to do without asking why (detailed explanations will be provided in a later section, promise): in your terminal, in the django_tutorial folder, run the following commands: 1 (django) django_tutorial$ python manage.py shell And once you're in the IPython shell: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Python 3.9.7 | packaged by conda - forge | ( default , Sep 29 2021 , 19 : 20 : 46 ) Type 'copyright' , 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 7.30.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python .

In settings.py , add your users app to INSTALLED_APPS and point AUTH_USER_MODEL to it: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # other settings INSTALLED_APPS = [ # other apps 'conduit.users' ] AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.User' Why no REST? # Because our entire frontend is integrated into Django (through HTML templates and HTMX), and given the scope of tutorial, we can implement the whole app without building a REST API.

Create a database # Django uses a sqlite database by default: it's versatile, simple, and sufficient for our needs, so we'll go with that, for now.

In this case, we could move the <div class=\"article-preview\"> to a separate file. Let's move all the code in the {% for article in articles %} for loop into the file article_preview.html (which we need to create).

We want the slugs to be unique, but some articles might have the same titles, which would generate the same slugs. One solution to this problem is to combine slugs with UUIDs. Defining a slug and a UUID in the model # First, we need to modify our Article model to include a slug, and to update the get_absolute_url method: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class Article ( models .

Please select a fix: 1 ) Provide a one-off default now ( will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column ) 2 ) Quit, and let me add a default in models.py Select an option: We can't select 1 because a default is by definition non-unique. We select 2 to abort and add the null=True arg to the slug field, so as to be able to migrate and then modify the slug manually through the Django admin app: 1 2 3 4 class Article ( models . Model ): # ... slug = models . SlugField ( max_length = 100 , null = True ) # ... We then run makemigrations and migrate , then set a unique slug for each Article through the Django admin app manually. Once we're done, we remove the null=True arg and add the editable=False arg: 1 2 3 4 class Article ( models . Model ): # ... slug = models . SlugField ( max_length = 255 , editable = False ) # new # ...

The Django docs say \u201c it may be more suitable to store app-specific user information in a model that has a relation with your custom user model. That allows each app to specify its own user data requirements without potentially conflicting or breaking assumptions by other apps. It also means that you would keep your user model as simple as possible, focused on authentication, and following the minimum requirements Django expects custom user models to meet. \u201d. This is why we'll have the authentication logic in a User model and the profile logic in a Profile model. User model # Creating the User model # The User model will contain everything related to authentication. We need an email, a username, and a password. Let's add the following to the User model in users/models.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser from django.db import models class User ( AbstractUser ): \"\"\"User model\"\"\" username = models .

We specify this in USERNAME_FIELD . The password field is already provided by AbstractUser . REQUIRED_FIELDS is the list of field users will be prompted for at sign up: because the USERNAME_FIELD and the password are already required by Django, we only need to specify username . More information about the fields can be found in the docs for the default Django User model . Creating the UserManager # We also need a UserManager , as advised by the docs . In models.py , we add the following, BEFORE we define our User model: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 # other imports from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser , UserManager # other models class CustomUserManager ( UserManager ): \"\"\"custom UserManager with unique identifier is email instead of username\"\"\" def create_user ( self , username , email , password = None ): \"\"\"Create and return a User with username, email, and password\"\"\" if email is None : raise ValueError ( \"Email is required.\" ) if username is None : raise ValueError ( \"Username is required\" ) email = self . normalize_email ( email ) user = self . model ( username = username , email = email ) user . set_password ( password ) user . save () return user def create_superuser ( self , username , email , password = None ): \"\"\"Create and return a SuperUser with admin permissions.\"\"\" user = self . create_user ( username , email , password ) user . is_staff = True user . is_superuser = True user . is_active = True user . save () return user create_user and create_superuser are self-explanatory.

Our Profile needs the following fields: image bio articles comments We have already taken care of the two last fields in the Article and Comment models through the ForeignKey relationships. We will allow users to specify a URL to their avatar and to write a short bio. This is optional, so we make sure to have blank=True .

Automating the creation of profiles for each new user # Since we're defining the Profile outside of the User model, a profile won't be created automatically whenever a user signs up. Let's follow the docs linked above and code up a signal that creates a Profile at user sign-up.

That is, we want to allow users to update two models at the same URL. Surprisingly, this common use case is not straightforward to implement with Django, especially if we're trying to follow good practice and use class-based views. Take a break before continuing, as we're going to go into the weeds here. Cool, let's recap what we're doing. We have two models ( User and Profile ), which happen to be related with a OneToOneField . We want to update these models in one place. Intuitively, we'll reach for the UpdateView . The problem is that UpdateView expects a single model. The solution is to tell our UpdateView to deal with two forms. Forms # Let's create users/forms.py and define two forms, one for each model: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 from django import forms from .models import Profile , User class ProfileForm ( forms . ModelForm ): class Meta : model = Profile fields = [ \"image\" , \"bio\" ] class UserForm ( forms . ModelForm ): new_password = forms . CharField ( required = False ) class Meta : model = User fields = [ \"username\" , \"email\" , \"new_password\" ] def save ( self , commit = True ): user = super () . save ( commit = False ) new_password = self . cleaned_data . get ( \"new_password\" ) if new_password : user . set_password ( new_password ) user . save () return user ModelForm allows to get a lot of model-relevant form logic for free (Django's \u201cbatteries included\u201d philosophy). The ProfileForm is self-explanatory. The UserForm is a bit more complicated. Let's go through it in detail. We want our user to be able to update three types of information: the username, the email, and the password. We also want to expose the current username and email values in the template, but we don't want to expose any information about the password. The screenshot below clarifies what we mean here: the screenshot on the right could leak information about the number of characters in our user's password, even though the characters themselves are masked, while the screenshot on the right exposes no information about the password. Password field with masked characters Empty password field We want the password field in our future template to be empty, and we don't want to force the user to type it out every time they want to modify some other information. In other words, we want the password field to be optional, i.e. required=False . Furthermore, since this password field doesn't need any information about the current password, we can just create a dummy new_password field, instead of linking our form to the User model's actual password attribute. Finally, when we save the form, we only want to update the password if the user has actually changed it on the form, so we need to override the form's save method. Also, because Django saves hashes of passwords, instead of the raw password strings, in its database, we need to use the User object's set_password method, which takes care of the password hashing. Views # Now that our forms are ready, let's create the view. As we said earlier, the intuitive choice here is the generic UpdateView class-based view. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # other imports from django.views.generic import CreateView , DetailView , UpdateView from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin # other classes class ProfileUpdateView ( LoginRequiredMixin , UpdateView ): form_class = ProfileForm template_name = \"settings.html\" success_url = reverse_lazy ( \"settings\" ) def get_object ( self , queryset = None ): return self . request . user . profile def get_context_data ( self , ** kwargs ): context = super () . get_context_data ( ** kwargs ) context [ \"user_form\" ] = UserForm ( instance = self . request . user ) return context def post ( self , request , * args , ** kwargs ): profile_form = self . form_class ( request .

POST , instance = request . user ) if profile_form . is_valid () and user_form . is_valid (): profile_form . save () user_form . save () return redirect ( self . success_url ) return super () . post ( request , * args , ** kwargs ) Again, this is a significant amount of code, so let's go through it slowly. Only logged-in users should be able to edit their profile information, hence the LoginRequiredMixin . UpdateView expects to deal with a single form by default, and every form requires a queryset, and some explicitly-defined fields or form_class . However, we want our UpdateView to deal with two forms: we will pass one form to the view in the way it expects, and the other we will pass as extra context data. We tell our UpdateView that its (official) form will be of the class ProfileForm and that its queryset will be a single instance of the Profile model: namely, the users will only be able to update their own profile (hence the get_object override). The additional form that ProfileUpdateView needs to deal with will be of class UserForm and will have self.request.user as its queryset. We also tell ProfileUpdateView that we'll want to refer to this form by user_form in our template. Finally, we need to process the two forms, which means that we need to override UpdateView 's post method. We take our whole POST request and run it through both ProfileForm and UserForm : this means that we let the forms take in the whole of the data, pick what they need (i.e. what corresponds to their fields), and apply it to the relevant objects. If our forms are valid, we can save the information. Otherwise, we reject the input (and re-render everything with relevant error information).
