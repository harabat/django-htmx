I hope it will contribute to closing the gap in the learning materials available to \u201cmedium to advanced beginners\u201d: those who have built every fake blog in existence, but who don't don't benefit from more in-depth resources because they don't have a real codebase to work on. We are aiming to build a tutorial that will teach the user to debug Django, to read the docs, to implement features that are not built-in. We will be bumping into errors, reading error messages, and sometimes even using actual debuggers to fix our app. We'll be jumping in and out of the shell to see how the internals function. Whenever we need to implement a feature, we'll take the path that teaches us Django (but also show the alternative that simply solves the specific problem). Hopefully this will provide you (and us) with a good grasp of Django.

You should git commit at the end of every chapter. Optional faker , to avoid creating placeholder users, articles and comments, manually Knowledge DjangoGirls tutorial You should have followed the DjangoGirls tutorial before starting this one: it is great for getting you up to speed, and covers most of the introductory material you'll need, like HTML, CSS, and, of course, Django. We'll assume you have completed that tutorial and won't go into the specifics of anything that has already been covered there. What we'll be doing # First, we'll decide on a project and folder structure, to keep the project's complexity in check. We'll also do the groundwork required by Django before we can get our app running online. We'll then dive into the tutorial proper: we'll make our first models, views, templates. We'll also create some articles through the Django admin app to have something nice to look at. Next, we'll spend some time on implementing features for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting articles. We'll then implement the same things for comments. After that, we'll spend a while on authentication and profile features (which includes follows, favorites, and tags). At this point, our app will be as finished as can be with Django alone. Finally, we'll implement HTMX and AlpineJS to make our app indistinguishable from a traditional SPA. Why no REST? # Because our entire frontend is integrated into Django (through HTML templates and HTMX), and given the scope of tutorial, we can implement the whole app without building a REST API. So we won't. This has a few benefits: we keep the structure of the app simple we keep the mental load light: no need to understand how Django REST Framework (the preferred way of implementing REST APIs in Django) works, no need to juggle with serializers, routers, renderers, etc., no need to complicate the codebase because we don't use a REST API, we don't need to implement JWT authentication, which is a general pain: we can just rely on Django's built-in authentication solutions, which are robust and simple to implement. The cons of this decision are that we won't be able to learn what there is to learn about building REST APIs with Django, which is a major use case for the framework: maybe a future version of this tutorial will include a chapter on this (but for now we want to let HTMX and AlpineJS shine).

In this chapter: we'll set up everything we'll need to start coding (our virtual environment and our project directories) we'll learn how to structure a Django project, how to create applications, how to change settings we'll write several models, create a database, use the famed Django admin, and finally get our app running locally. Virtual environment # Before doing anything else, we need to create our virtual environment. We're working with conda ( tutorial ), but you can use your favourite virtual lib, like virtualenv ( tutorial ). 1 2 3 ~$ conda create --name django ( django ) ~$ conda activate django ( django ) ~$ conda install django faker Now, you have a virtual environment with django and faker installed. Project layout and folder structure # We'll be following a simplified version of the folder structure described in the Two Scoops of Django by Daniel and Audrey Feldroy. We want our folder structure to look something like the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 folder_name \u251c\u2500\u2500 config/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 asgi.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 settings/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 urls.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 wsgi.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 project_name/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 app_1/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 app_2/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 static/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 manage.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 db.sqlite3 Before we get there, however, we need to go through the Django defaults. Let's create a folder for our project: we'll name it django_tutorial . After that, we'll create our project, conduit , inside django_tutorial : 1 2 3 ( django ) ~$ mkdir django_tutorial ( django ) ~$ cd django_tutorial ( django ) django_tutorial$ django-admin startproject conduit . Advice We strongly recommend you use git when going through this tutorial. Our folder structure should look like this at this point: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 django_tutorial \u251c\u2500\u2500 conduit \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 asgi.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 settings.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 urls.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 wsgi.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 manage.py We'll move all the files in the conduit folder into the django_tutorial/config folder, as we explained above. The project layout should now be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 django_tutorial \u251c\u2500\u2500 conduit \u2502\u2500\u2500 config \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 asgi.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 settings.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 urls.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 wsgi.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 manage.py Because we're deviating from Django's generic project layout, we'll have to update some lines in the settings. You might wonder why we have to fiddle with the settings before even starting to code, but this small effort has the benefit of making the structure of our project easier to understand, and of separating the config from the code, which is a good habit to get into. In config/asgi.py , config/wsgi.py , and ./manage.py , we update the location of our settings.py file: 1 2 3 4 # ... # os.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"conduit.settings\") # from this os . environ . setdefault ( \"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\" , \"config.settings\" ) # to this We do the same in config/settings.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # ... # ROOT_URLCONF = \"conduit.urls\" # from this ROOT_URLCONF = \"config.urls\" # to this # WSGI_APPLICATION = \"conduit.wsgi.application\" # from this WSGI_APPLICATION = \"config.wsgi.application\" # to this Done! We have implemented a project layout that separates the config (in the config folder) from the code (in the conduit folder) and told Django to take this into account. Our app will have a lot of moving parts (articles, profiles, tags, etc.). To keep the structure of our app clear, we'll host the logic for each of these parts in separate folders. We'll build Conduit step by step. articles application # The most basic function that the Conduit app should have is the ability to post and read articles. Let's start with that (you'll notice that this part is basically a repeat of DjangoGirls tutorial 's blog app). We'll create an articles application (a package that provides a specific set of features) that will hold all the logic that is related to dealing with articles. 1 2 3 ( django ) django_tutorial$ cd conduit ( django ) conduit$ django-admin startapp articles ( django ) conduit$ cd articles Our folder structure now looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 django_tutorial \u251c\u2500\u2500 conduit \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 articles \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 admin.py \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 apps.py \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 migrations \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 models.py \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests.py \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 views.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 config \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 asgi.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 settings.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 urls.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 wsgi.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 manage.py Because of our folder structure, we will need to make a small adjustment in the file articles/apps.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from django.apps import AppConfig class ArticlesConfig ( AppConfig ): default_auto_field = \"django.db.models.BigAutoField\" # name = \"articles\" # from this name = \"conduit.articles\" # to this We also add the articles application to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in config/settings.py , in order to let Django know about our new app articles : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 INSTALLED_APPS = [ \"django.contrib.admin\" , \"django.contrib.auth\" , \"django.contrib.contenttypes\" , \"django.contrib.sessions\" , \"django.contrib.messages\" , \"django.contrib.staticfiles\" , \"conduit.articles\" , # new ] users app and User model # The Django docs warn you : \u201c If you're starting a new project, it's highly recommended to set up a custom user model, even if the default User model is sufficient for you. [\u2026] Changing AUTH_USER_MODEL after you've created database tables is significantly more difficult [\u2026]. This change can't be done automatically and requires manually fixing your schema, moving your data from the old user table, and possibly manually reapplying some migrations. \u201d. Scary stuff. Let's just follow the advice. First, we need to create the app where we'll put all the logic that has to do with users. 1 ( django ) conduit$ django-admin startapp users We remember to take into account our folder structure in users/apps.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from django.apps import AppConfig class UsersConfig ( AppConfig ): default_auto_field = \"django.db.models.BigAutoField\" # name = \"users\" # from this name = \"conduit.users\" # to this And we add the new users application to our INSTALLED_APPS in config/settings.py : 1 2 3 4 5 # ... INSTALLED_APPS = [ # ... \"conduit.users\" , # new ] Now, in users/models.py , add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser from django.db import models class User ( AbstractUser ): \"\"\"Custom user model.\"\"\" pass What we're doing here is exactly what the Django docs advise us to do : we take the AbstractUser model and save it as is, which will provide us with a custom user model. This way, we can add any modifications that we need later on. Finally, we need to tell Django that we're not using the default User model. In config/settings.py , point AUTH_USER_MODEL to it: 1 2 # ... AUTH_USER_MODEL = \"users.User\" # new Great, our user application and our custom User model are ready. Create a database # Django uses a SQLite database by default: it's versatile, simple, and sufficient for our needs. Django also supports other databases, notably PostgreSQL, which is what we would want to use if our app was expected to grow fast, but for now we will stay with SQLite. Info We would arguably learn more by setting up a PosgreSQL database: SQLite is a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d, \u201cjust works\u201d type of thing. Since learning more is the point of this tutorial, we might shift to PostgreSQL at some point. After any change to a model, we need to sync the database so that the changes can be propagated into the database schema . If you don't yet know what that means, no worries: we'll have a much closer look at what exactly is in our database, and what happens when we run migrations. Specifically in this case, we want Django to create an Article table that will hold our articles. Since we changed the Articles model, we will run the following commands: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py makemigrations # Operations to perform: # Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py migrate # Operations to perform: # Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users # Running migrations: # Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

OK # Applying admin.0003_logentry_add_action_flag_choices... OK # Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK We'll be doing this many times throughout the tutorial: if your app refuses to run at some point, the most likely error (from experience) is that you forgot to migrate, so make sure you keep on top of it. Create a superuser # One of Django's greatest advantages is its admin app: it is considered so helpful that you probably will see it mentioned in most discussions about Django. To be able to access the admin app (which we will do in a later section), we need a superuser . Run the following and fill the values (you don't need a real email or a strong password here): 1 2 3 4 5 6 ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py createsuperuser # Username (leave blank to use $CURRENTUSER): admin # Email address: admin@example.com # Password: # Password (again): # Superuser created successfully. Profile model # In users/models.py we also need to create a Profile model: we'll explain it in more detail later, but suffice it to say that the Profile will deal with everything about our users that is not authentication (ie logging in and out). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # ... class Profile ( models . Model ): \"\"\"Profile model associated to each User object.\"\"\" user = models . OneToOneField ( User , on_delete = models . CASCADE ) def __str__ ( self ): return self . user . username We'll go through the code step by step: The docs for the OneToOneField model field read: \u201c A one-to-one relationship. Conceptually, this is similar to a ForeignKey with unique=True, but the \u201creverse\u201d side of the relation will directly return a single object. This is most useful as the primary key of a model which \u201cextends\u201d another model in some way \u201d. This is exactly we need, because each User has one associated Profile , and each Profile corresponds to a single User . on_delete is a required argument for OneToOneField and specifies what happens when the model instance is deleted. the __str__ method tells Django what the string representation of the model should be: this is how specific model instances will be represented in the Django admin app, in the shell, in the error messages, in the templates, etc. Here, we specify that we want our profiles to be referenced by the associated user's username. Now that we have a Profile model, we want to create one for our existing user (the admin superuser). Later on, we will automate the creation of a profile for every new user, but this is not implemented yet, so we need to do it manually. Well, thankfully Django allows us to interact with it through a Python shell . 1 (django) django_tutorial$ python manage.py shell And now that we're in the IPython shell, we will interact with the Django ORM: we will get our admin user from the User objects and then create a Profile instance. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Python 3.9.7 | packaged by conda - forge | ( default , Sep 29 2021 , 19 : 20 : 46 ) Type 'copyright' , 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 7.30.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python . Type '?' for help . In [ 1 ]: from conduit.users.models import User , Profile In [ 2 ]: user = User . objects . get ( username = 'admin' ) In [ 3 ]: user . profile = Profile . objects . create ( user = user ) If you've been following up to now\u2026 you should have gotten an error above. Namely, you should have gotten: OperationalError: no such table: users_profile 90% of programming is writing code, and the other 90% of programming is debugging, as the saying goes, so we might as well learn to deal with Django's errors while learning Django. The error above says that our database has no table users_profile : why might that be? Because we didn't sync our database after modifying our models! Open a new terminal session and run migrations: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py makemigrations # Migrations for 'users': # conduit/users/migrations/0002_profile.py # - Create model Profile ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py migrate # Operations to perform: # Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users # Running migrations: # Applying users.0002_profile... OK Now return to the previous session and rerun the shell command: there should be no error this time. Start the server # We have everything we need to actually run our app. Let's start the server ! 1 ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py runserver You should see this: python manage.py runserver Our app, Conduit , is online! Article model # We'll start by making a model for our articles. When creating a model, we need to think of what fields the model will need. Let's take 2 seconds to think. Any article needs: a title a body (the text) a description an author a creation date. Let's implement that in articles/models.py . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 from django.db import models class Article ( models . Model ): \"\"\"Article model.\"\"\" title = models . CharField ( db_index = True , max_length = 255 ) description = models . TextField ( max_length = 2000 ) body = models . TextField () author = models . ForeignKey ( \"users.Profile\" , on_delete = models . CASCADE , related_name = \"articles\" , ) created_at = models . DateTimeField ( auto_now_add = True ) def __str__ ( self ): return self . title Let's explain everything step by step: the article's title will be used as db_index : when we do queries on articles in our database, we'll often be looking at the title , so having this field as index will speed the queries description and body are self-explanatory author is a bit more complicated: the ForeignKey model field allows us to have a many-to-one relationship: multiple articles for every profile we have seen on_delete , but not related_name : related_name=\"articles\" allows us to access a user's (or rather profile's) articles through an articles attribute (for example, User.articles.all() to get the admin user's articles) auto_now_add simply records the time of creation for created_at the __str__ method says that the string representation of an article will be its title Let's sync the database again: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py makemigrations # Migrations for 'articles': # conduit/articles/migrations/0001_initial.py # - Create model Article ( django ) django_tutorial$ python manage.py migrate # Operations to perform: # Apply all migrations: admin, articles, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users # Running migrations: # Applying articles.0001_initial... OK Using the Django admin # In order to have something to work with for the rest of the tutorial, we need to create some posts. Because we can't yet do it through Conduit , we will do so through Django admin.

This is most useful as the primary key of a model which \u201cextends\u201d another model in some way \u201d. This is exactly we need, because each User has one associated Profile , and each Profile corresponds to a single User . on_delete is a required argument for OneToOneField and specifies what happens when the model instance is deleted. the __str__ method tells Django what the string representation of the model should be: this is how specific model instances will be represented in the Django admin app, in the shell, in the error messages, in the templates, etc. Here, we specify that we want our profiles to be referenced by the associated user's username. Now that we have a Profile model, we want to create one for our existing user (the admin superuser). Later on, we will automate the creation of a profile for every new user, but this is not implemented yet, so we need to do it manually. Well, thankfully Django allows us to interact with it through a Python shell . 1 (django) django_tutorial$ python manage.py shell And now that we're in the IPython shell, we will interact with the Django ORM: we will get our admin user from the User objects and then create a Profile instance. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Python 3.9.7 | packaged by conda - forge | ( default , Sep 29 2021 , 19 : 20 : 46 ) Type 'copyright' , 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 7.30.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python .

That's what we need to implement. In articles/views.py , we add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 from django.views.generic import ListView from .models import Article class Home ( ListView ): \"\"\"View all published articles for the global feed.\"\"\" queryset = Article . objects . order_by ( \"-created_at\" ) context_object_name = \"articles\" Step by step: The ListView generic display view displays list of objects: the Django Girls tutorial only presents Function-Based Views, which are arguably a more intuitive option, but Class-Based Views (or CBVs) are considered to be best practice, at least according to Two Scoops of Django , and simplify a lot of work the queryset attribute (which is shorthand for the get_queryset method) allows us to filter the list of objects returned by ListView the way we need (here, we order them from most to least recent), while the default would be to simply specify model = Article and get Article.objects.all() the context_object_name attribute provides a human-friendly name for the context for us to use in the template (by default, the context would be stored in a variable named object_list ). Home URL # If you followed any previous tutorial, you will remember that, in order to display a view, we need to specify what URL it corresponds to. To keep our app logic clear, we will be keeping everything segregated across our apps: since we want to implement a view of the list of all articles, we will specify the URLs in our articles folder. Let's create a articles/urls.py , and add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from django.urls import path from .views import Home urlpatterns = [ path ( \"\" , Home . as_view (), name = \"home\" ), ] We're telling our Articles app that the root URL ( http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ) should return the view Home that we created in the previous section. However, Django doesn't know to look into articles/urls.py : it is only aware of the default urls.py file created earlier in the previous chapter. We add the following line in config/urls.py , so that the project-level urls.py is aware of the app-level URLs defined in articles/urls.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path , include # new urlpatterns = [ path ( \"admin/\" , admin . site . urls ), path ( \"\" , include ( \"conduit.articles.urls\" )), # new ] Templates and static files # We have a Home view and URL: we need a template now. In keeping with our commitment to keeping the structure of our project clear and logical, we will create a single project-wide folder for all templates, and we'll do the same for static files (icons, CSS, etc.): this kind of code is going to be heavily shared by both articles and users apps, so it's better to have a folder for the whole project than one for each app (all the more so that our apps are not expected to be plugged into other projects). Let's create the templates and static folders: 1 2 ( django ) conduit$ mkdir templates ( django ) conduit$ mkdir static We need to modify config/settings.py so Django is aware of our project's architecture. Let's define the APPS_DIR below BASE_DIR first: it will point to our conduit folder and will make the next modifications a bit shorter. 1 2 3 # ... BASE_DIR = Path ( __file__ ) . resolve () . parent . parent APPS_DIR = BASE_DIR / \"conduit\" # new The TEMPLATES section of config/settings.py holds the template-related settings: that's where we need to notify Django about where our templates are. The DIRS setting, which indicates the location of template source files should point to our new conduit/templates folder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 TEMPLATES = [ { # ... # \"DIRS\": [], # from this \"DIRS\" : [ APPS_DIR / \"templates\" ], # to this }, ] We will also change the STATICFILES_DIRS setting in the static files section of config/settings.py so that it points to our new conduit/static folder: 1 2 3 # ... STATIC_URL = \"/static/\" STATICFILES_DIRS = [ APPS_DIR / \"static\" ] # new Base template # Before we start writing the templates, a few words. As stated in the introduction, the HTML is adapted from other RealWorld projects: mostly the Svelte implementation (because Svelte is unexpectedly close to Django's templating language), but we also picked and chose from other projects, both in situations where the code or the file structure were more in line with what we needed here, or when the UI of one implementation was better in some way. However, because we're building the app from scratch (adding features, changing the UI, etc.), our file structure and code will be affected. The HTML of the finished Conduit app should be almost identical to any other implementation's HTML (take or leave some specificities of our chosen frameworks). Because this is not an HTML or UI tutorial, we won't be explaining the HTML files' structure, the classes, the CSS, etc. Onwards!

The issue is that Django expects a template named article_list.html, which is the default template expected by our Home view, which is a ListView for the Article model. To fix that, we need to go to articles/views.py and add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 class Home ( ListView ): \"\"\"View all published articles for the global feed.\"\"\" template_name = \"home.html\" # new queryset = Article . objects . order_by ( \"-created_at\" ) context_object_name = \"articles\" Try reloading again and this is what you should see: Global feed in our app Global feed in the RealWorld app It's starting to look like something!

The structure of the Svelte implementation makes a lot of sense and avoids us having to reinvent the wheel, so we'll take advantage of it. Specifically, we will copy the Svelte implementation's ArticleList structure by moving the whole {% if articles|length_is:\"0\" %}...{% endif %} clause HTML out of templates/home.html and into two separate files.

However, because we're building the app from scratch (adding features, changing the UI, etc.), our file structure and code will be affected.

The DetailView generic display view allows to view a single instance of an object. We specify the model this view will be associated to and the template name. Article URLs and primary keys # We now match a URL to the ArticleDetailView in articles/urls.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 from .views import ArticleDetailView , Home # new urlpatterns = [ path ( \"\" , Home . as_view (), name = \"home\" ), path ( \"article/<int:pk>\" , ArticleDetailView . as_view (), name = \"article_detail\" ), # new ] This is the first time we're actually specifying a URL with arguments. Django's URL dispatcher docs have a lot of information on the ins and outs, but for now we only need to know that the current URL comprises an articles/ prefix and the article's key. The <int:pk> parameter here matches any integer, and transfers the captured value to ArticleDetailView , which tries to identify the article based on its primary key ( pk ): primary keys are a way to uniquely specify a record in a database. Since we didn't specify how to generate primary keys for the Article objects in our database, this will default to an incrementing integer (the first article will have a pk of 1, the next will have a pk of 2, etc.). To have an idea, and to practice your shell skills, launch the interactive shell (by running python manage.py shell ) and run the following commands: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Python 3.9.13 | packaged by conda - forge | ( main , May 27 2022 , 16 : 56 : 21 ) Type 'copyright' , 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 7.33.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python .

And the URLs are plain unclear. We'll change the primary keys later on. get_absolute_url method # In order for ArticleDetailView to be able to identify an Article object from its pk , we need to modify the Article model in articles/models.py (don't forget to sync the database immediately after): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 from django.db import models from django.shortcuts import reverse # new class Article ( models .

In order to display these fields, we need to override how the Django admin represents the Article model. In articles/admin.py , add the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 #... class ArticleAdmin ( admin . ModelAdmin ): # new readonly_fields = ( \"slug_uuid\" , \"uuid_field\" ) # # admin.site.register(Article, ArticleAdmin) # from this admin . site . register ( Article , ArticleAdmin ) # to this Here, we define subclass a ModelAdmin class (which defines how a model is represented in the Django admin) and add the non-editable fields we want to see to the new class's readonly_fields attribute . If you have a look at some of the existing articles, you'll be able to see their slug_uuid and uuid_field fields now. Generate unique slug_uuid fields with utility functions # We want to avoid manually entering the slugs for every article: the generation of a unique slug_uuid should be triggered automatically every time an Article instance is saved. Because our choice of slug is not the simplest, it doesn't come included with Django: we will need to create this functionality. When we need to define new functions in order to add some new functionality to Django, the common pattern is to create a utility module (generally a utils.py file) and import the functions from there. This enables reuse, allows to keep code in models and views short, and facilitates testing. Depending on the scope of the utility functions, utils.py can be placed within the project, or simply at the level of the app. In our case, we only need a function that will create unique slugs for articles, the scope of the utility module is the articles app, so we create the utils.py file in the articles folder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 from django.utils.text import slugify def slug_uuid_generator ( instance ): \"\"\"Generate a unique slug_uuid for Articles from the title and a UUID.\"\"\" # if the instance already has a `slug_uuid`, don't change it # to avoid changing URLs if instance . slug_uuid : return instance . slug_uuid # get the instance's class (`Article`) ArticleClass = instance . __class__ # get max length of `slug_uuid` as defined in the `Article` model max_length = ArticleClass . _meta . get_field ( \"slug_uuid\" ) . max_length uuid_field = str ( instance . uuid_field ) uuid_length = len ( uuid_field ) # slugify instance's title # trim slug to leave space for UUID slug_field = slugify ( instance . title )[: max_length - uuid_length - 1 ] # create `slug_uuid` by concatenating slugified title and UUID slug_uuid = \" {slug_field} - {uuid_field} \" . format ( slug_field = slug_field , uuid_field = uuid_field , ) return slug_uuid This looks complicated, because it is, at our current level. What we want to happen is the following: when a new article (ie a new instance of the Article model) is saved, we want a function to take that instance as an argument, extract its title and UUID, slugify the title, concatenate the slug with the UUID, and set the resulting string as that instance's slug_uuid field value. There's also a condition: if the article already has a slug_uuid (and is being saved after a simple update), then we don't want to change the slug_uuid , because that would change the URL and cool URLs don't change . Walking through the function step by step, you can check that it is exactly what we're doing. Override save method instead of creating signals (alternative) # One way to call slug_uuid_generator at the moment of saving an article would be to override the Article model's save method : this is a common method, but not best practice . The next section is rather complicated, so if you prefer to keep things simple for now, you can just add the code below to your articles/models.py and skip straight to Adapt URLs and views to slug_uuid fields : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # ... from .utils import slug_uuid_generator # new class Article ( models . Model ): # ... def save ( self , * args , ** kwargs ): # new self . slug_uuid = slug_uuid_generator ( self ) # super () . save ( * args , ** kwargs ) # We advise you to implement signals instead however, both in order to get some of that sweet Django learning, but also because this method will keep your code readable when your save method overrides start being 50 lines long. Generate slug_uuid fields automatically with signals # The function in the utils.py file should be called at the moment of saving a new Article instance: this step does not happen in the utils.py file, but in the file we will create next. We create the articles/signals.py file and add the following method to it: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 from django.db.models.signals import pre_save from django.dispatch import receiver from .models import Article from .utils import slug_uuid_generator @receiver ( pre_save , sender = Article ) def generate_slug_uuid_before_article_save ( sender , instance , * args , ** kwargs ): \"\"\"Call slug_uuid_generator function when saving `Article` instance.\"\"\" instance . slug_uuid = slug_uuid_generator ( instance ) We use a signal to call our slug_uuid_generator every time an Article instance is created. Signals are a Django utility that allows applications (\u201creceivers\u201d) within Django to be notified (by \u201csenders\u201d) when certain actions happen. In this case, the sender is the Article model. We want our slug_uuid to be generated just before an article is saved, so we want to use the pre_save signal , which is sent before a model's save method is called. The receiver function pre_save_receiver generates a slug_uuid by calling slug_uuid_generator . We specify that pre_save_receiver is the receiver with the receiver decorator . In order to activate this signal, we will modify articles/apps.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from django.apps import AppConfig class ArticlesConfig ( AppConfig ): default_auto_field = \"django.db.models.BigAutoField\" name = \"conduit.articles\" def ready ( self ): # new from . import signals # new The ready method allows us to register the signals, and because we are using a receiver decorator, the signal handlers are connected implicitly by just importing them. We're ready to test our slug_uuid generation: let's try creating an Article through the Django admin app. Write some placeholder text in the title, description, and body, then select your superuser as the author, and save: you should be able to see the article in the Django admin and you can check that it has a nice slug_uuid value. Try changing the title of that article, save, and check that the slug_uuid has not changed. Adapt URLs and views to slug_uuid fields # Since we want to have slug_uuid parameters in our articles' URLs, we need to change urlpatterns in articles/urls.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # ... urlpatterns = [ # ... # path(\"article/<int:pk>\", ArticleDetailView.as_view(), name=\"article_detail\"), # from this path ( # to this \"article/<slug:slug_uuid>\" , ArticleDetailView . as_view (), name = \"article_detail\" # ), # ] Here, we tell Django's URL dispatcher to call the ArticleDetailView with the slug_uuid parameter, which is matched by the slug path converter in the URL. We're not finished just yet: if you navigate to your Conduit app at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and hover over the article previews, you'll see that the hyperlinks still point to URLs with a pk value. To remedy this, we need to update the get_absolute_url method in articles/models.py , so that our links in templates specify URLs with the article's slug_uuid value: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # ... class Article ( models . Model ): # ... def get_absolute_url ( self ): # return reverse(\"article_detail\", kwargs={\"pk\": self.pk}) # from this return reverse ( \"article_detail\" , kwargs = { \"slug_uuid\" : self . slug_uuid }) # to this If you try to view a specific article now, you should get the following error: AttributeError at /article/onetoonefield Generic detail view ArticleDetailView must be called with either an object pk or a slug in the URLconf. Request Method: GET Request URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/article/onetoonefield This means that our ArticleDetailView , which is the interface that allows to identify the relevant model instance given a specific URL, is expecting either a pk or a slug parameter. We have a few options: we can simply rename our slug_uuid fields to slug and be done with it we can teach our ArticleDetailView to identify Article instances based on the slug_uuid field By now, you probably know that we're obviously going to choose the\u2026 second, more complicated option. Because we'll learn more that way. In articles/views.py : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 #... from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404 # new class ArticleDetailView ( DetailView ): # ... def get_object ( self ): # new slug_uuid = self . kwargs . get ( \"slug_uuid\" ) # return get_object_or_404 ( Article , slug_uuid = slug_uuid ) # Looks complicated, doesn't it? Wish we had chosen the easy way out. Anyway, let's try to understand. When the URL dispatcher gets a request at a specific URL, it passes the data from the request (the URL itself, whether the user's logged in, whether the user's on a premium plan, etc.) to the view. Inside the view, we can access this data. The request data is included into the self argument that the get_object method gets. From the request, we can extract the keyword arguments, or the kwargs. We're interested in the slug_uuid kwarg, specifically. Once we have the slug_uuid value, we can retrieve the desired Article model instance. When going back to http://localhost:8000/ (where your app is running), you will see that your new article has a slug_uuid consisting of its slugified title and a UUID: slug_uuid fields slug and uuid_field instead of slug_uuid (alternative) # We have seen how to override the way instances of a model are retrieved by Django, but there is also a much simpler alternative to what we just did. Making slugs and UUIDs is a common requirement, so Django facilitates tasks around working with such fields. The code below assumes that we are back to the very start of this chapter, just after finishing the Viewing Articles chapter. In our articles/models.py , we create slug and uuid_field fields (we have to specify null=True , create slug values for the existing articles, then specify editable=False , like we did above): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # ... import uuid # new class Article ( models . Model ): # ... slug = models . SlugField ( max_length = 68 , editable = False ) # new uuid_field = models . UUIDField ( default = uuid . uuid4 , editable = False ) # new Still in articles/models.py , we override the save method to generate slugs at save: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # ... from django.utils.text import slugify class Article ( models . Model ): # ... def save ( self , * args , ** kwargs ): self . slug = slugify ( self . title ) super () . save ( * args , ** kwargs ) In articles/urls.py , we add our new URL: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # ... urlpatterns = [ # path(\"article/<int:pk>\", ArticleDetailView.as_view(), name=\"article_detail\"), # from this path ( # to this \"article/<slug:slug>-<uuid:uuid>\" , # ArticleDetailView . as_view (), # name = \"article_detail\" , # ), # ] In articles/models.py , we adapt get_absolute_url : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # ... class Article ( models .

Because our choice of slug is not the simplest, it doesn't come included with Django: we will need to create this functionality. When we need to define new functions in order to add some new functionality to Django, the common pattern is to create a utility module (generally a utils.py file) and import the functions from there. This enables reuse, allows to keep code in models and views short, and facilitates testing. Depending on the scope of the utility functions, utils.py can be placed within the project, or simply at the level of the app. In our case, we only need a function that will create unique slugs for articles, the scope of the utility module is the articles app, so we create the utils.py file in the articles folder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 from django.utils.text import slugify def slug_uuid_generator ( instance ): \"\"\"Generate a unique slug_uuid for Articles from the title and a UUID.\"\"\" # if the instance already has a `slug_uuid`, don't change it # to avoid changing URLs if instance . slug_uuid : return instance . slug_uuid # get the instance's class (`Article`) ArticleClass = instance . __class__ # get max length of `slug_uuid` as defined in the `Article` model max_length = ArticleClass . _meta . get_field ( \"slug_uuid\" ) . max_length uuid_field = str ( instance . uuid_field ) uuid_length = len ( uuid_field ) # slugify instance's title # trim slug to leave space for UUID slug_field = slugify ( instance . title )[: max_length - uuid_length - 1 ] # create `slug_uuid` by concatenating slugified title and UUID slug_uuid = \" {slug_field} - {uuid_field} \" . format ( slug_field = slug_field , uuid_field = uuid_field , ) return slug_uuid This looks complicated, because it is, at our current level.

When the URL dispatcher gets a request at a specific URL, it passes the data from the request (the URL itself, whether the user's logged in, whether the user's on a premium plan, etc.) to the view. Inside the view, we can access this data. The request data is included into the self argument that the get_object method gets. From the request, we can extract the keyword arguments, or the kwargs. We're interested in the slug_uuid kwarg, specifically. Once we have the slug_uuid value, we can retrieve the desired Article model instance.

While forms are one of Django's many strong points, there is a lot of new material to understand. The Django docs section that deals with forms says: Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms: preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering creating HTML forms for the data receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client <form method=\"post\"> Forms allow users to provide input to the website they're visiting, that the website can then process and act upon. We want to modify data server-side (we will create new Article instances), so we need to make a POST form (which we do with method=\"post\" ). {% csrf_token %} POST forms need to mitigate against Cross Site Request Forgeries , a type of malicious attack, but Django makes this very easy: in our case, we only need to include the {% csrf_token %} tag inside the <form> element (though you might have to do a bit more work in other circumstances ). {{ form.non_field_errors }} The {{ form.non_field_errors }} variable will display any errors that are not field-specific, which is why this variable is outside of any fieldsets. There are different ways to render a form: it depends on whether Django's defaults unpacking of form fields is sufficient, whether you need more flexibility in how you render the fields . We want a lot of flexibility (we want the fields to be in a specific order, to how distinct placeholder values). Add a navbar button # We add a New article button to the Nav bar in templates/nav.html (still copying Svelte's Nav.svelte template ): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 <!-- ... --> < ul class = \"nav navbar-nav pull-xs-right\" > < li class = \"nav-item\" > {% url 'home' as home %} <!-- new --> <!-- <a href=\"{% url 'home' %}\" rel=\"prefetch\" class=\"nav-link\"> --> <!-- from this --> < a <! -- to this -- > href=\"{{ home }}\" <!-- # --> rel=\"prefetch\" <!-- # --> class=\"nav-link {% if request.path == home %}active{% endif %}\" <!-- # --> > <!-- # --> Home </ a > </ li > < li class = \"nav-item\" > <!-- new --> {% url 'editor_create' as editor_create %} <!-- # --> < a <! -- # -- > href=\"{{ editor_create }}\" <!-- # --> rel=\"prefetch\" <!-- # --> class=\"nav-link {% if request.path == editor_create %}active{% endif %}\" <!-- # --> > <!-- # --> < span class = \"ion-compose\" > New Post </ span > <!-- # --> </ a > <!-- # --> </ li > <!-- # --> </ ul > We added {% url 'home' as home %} and class \"nav-link {% if request.path == home %}active{% endif %}\" to better style active links.

Let's override the EditorCreateView view's form_valid method in our views.py file: before we save the form, we'll set the logged in user ( admin , for now) as the author : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 class EditorCreateView ( CreateView ): \"\"\"create article\"\"\" model = Article fields = [ \"title\" , \"description\" , \"body\" ] template_name = \"editor.html\" def form_valid ( self , form ): # new self . object = form . save ( commit = False ) # self . object . author = self . request . user . profile # self . object . save () # return super () . form_valid ( form ) # Once this is done, try creating another article: it should work.

While forms are one of Django's many strong points, there is a lot of new material to understand. The Django docs section that deals with forms says: Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms: preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering creating HTML forms for the data receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client <form method=\"post\"> Forms allow users to provide input to the website they're visiting, that the website can then process and act upon. We want to modify data server-side (we will create new Article instances), so we need to make a POST form (which we do with method=\"post\" ). {% csrf_token %} POST forms need to mitigate against Cross Site Request Forgeries , a type of malicious attack, but Django makes this very easy: in our case, we only need to include the {% csrf_token %} tag inside the <form> element (though you might have to do a bit more work in other circumstances ). {{ form.non_field_errors }} The {{ form.non_field_errors }} variable will display any errors that are not field-specific, which is why this variable is outside of any fieldsets. There are different ways to render a form: it depends on whether Django's defaults unpacking of form fields is sufficient, whether you need more flexibility in how you render the fields . We want a lot of flexibility (we want the fields to be in a specific order, to how distinct placeholder values).","title":"Create a form"},{"location":"05_creating_editing_and_deleting_articles/#add-a-navbar-button","text":"We add a New article button to the Nav bar in templates/nav.html (still copying Svelte's Nav.svelte template ): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 <!-- ... --> < ul class = \"nav navbar-nav pull-xs-right\" > < li class = \"nav-item\" > {% url 'home' as home %} <!-- new --> <!-- <a href=\"{% url 'home' %}\" rel=\"prefetch\" class=\"nav-link\"> --> <!-- from this --> < a <! -- to this -- > href=\"{{ home }}\" <!-- # --> rel=\"prefetch\" <!-- # --> class=\"nav-link {% if request.path == home %}active{% endif %}\" <!-- # --> > <!-- # --> Home </ a > </ li > < li class = \"nav-item\" > <!-- new --> {% url 'editor_create' as editor_create %} <!-- # --> < a <! -- # -- > href=\"{{ editor_create }}\" <!-- # --> rel=\"prefetch\" <!-- # --> class=\"nav-link {% if request.path == editor_create %}active{% endif %}\" <!-- # --> > <!-- # --> < span class = \"ion-compose\" > New Post </ span > <!-- # --> </ a > <!-- # --> </ li > <!-- # --> </ ul > We added {% url 'home' as home %} and class \"nav-link {% if request.path == home %}active{% endif %}\" to better style active links.","title":"Add a navbar button"},{"location":"05_creating_editing_and_deleting_articles/#override-form_valid","text":"Try to create an article in your app. When you hit \u201cPublish\u201d, you'll get an error: IntegrityError at /editor NOT NULL constraint failed: articles_article.author_id That's because the form doesn't know who the author is, and author is a required field in our model.

A view of a profile, sans errors Viewing Articles written by each User # Whenever we visit a user's profile, we want to see all the articles written by that specific user.

That is, we want to allow users to update two models at the same URL. Surprisingly, this common use case is not straightforward to implement with Django, especially if we're trying to follow good practice and use class-based views. Take a break before continuing, as we're going to go into the weeds here. Cool, let's recap what we're doing. We have two models ( User and Profile ), which happen to be related with a OneToOneField . We want to update these models in one place. Intuitively, we'll reach for the UpdateView . The problem is that UpdateView expects a single model. The solution is to tell our UpdateView to deal with two forms. Forms # Let's create users/forms.py and define two forms, one for each model: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 from django import forms from .models import Profile , User class ProfileForm ( forms . ModelForm ): class Meta : model = Profile fields = [ \"image\" , \"bio\" ] class UserForm ( forms . ModelForm ): new_password = forms .

The ProfileForm is self-explanatory. The UserForm is a bit more complicated. Let's go through it in detail. We want our user to be able to update three types of information: the username, the email, and the password. We also want to expose the current username and email values in the template, but we don't want to expose any information about the password. The screenshot below clarifies what we mean here: the screenshot on the right could leak information about the number of characters in our user's password, even though the characters themselves are masked, while the screenshot on the right exposes no information about the password. Password field with masked characters Empty password field We want the password field in our future template to be empty, and we don't want to force the user to type it out every time they want to modify some other information. In other words, we want the password field to be optional, i.e. required=False . Furthermore, since this password field doesn't need any information about the current password, we can just create a dummy new_password field, instead of linking our form to the User model's actual password attribute. Finally, when we save the form, we only want to update the password if the user has actually changed it on the form, so we need to override the form's save method. Also, because Django saves hashes of passwords, instead of the raw password strings, in its database, we need to use the User object's set_password method, which takes care of the password hashing. Views # Now that our forms are ready, let's create the view. As we said earlier, the intuitive choice here is the generic UpdateView class-based view. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # ... from django.views.generic import CreateView , DetailView , UpdateView from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin # ... class ProfileUpdateView ( LoginRequiredMixin , UpdateView ): form_class = ProfileForm template_name = \"settings.html\" success_url = reverse_lazy ( \"settings\" ) def get_object ( self , queryset = None ): return self . request . user . profile def get_context_data ( self , ** kwargs ): context = super () . get_context_data ( ** kwargs ) context [ \"user_form\" ] = UserForm ( instance = self . request . user ) return context def post ( self , request , * args , ** kwargs ): profile_form = self . form_class ( request . POST , instance = request . user . profile ) user_form = UserForm ( request . POST , instance = request . user ) if profile_form . is_valid () and user_form . is_valid (): profile_form . save () user_form . save () return redirect ( self . success_url ) return super () . post ( request , * args , ** kwargs ) Again, this is a significant amount of code, so let's go through it slowly. Only logged-in users should be able to edit their profile information, hence the LoginRequiredMixin . UpdateView expects to deal with a single form by default, and every form requires a queryset, and some explicitly-defined fields or form_class . However, we want our UpdateView to deal with two forms: we will pass one form to the view in the way it expects, and the other we will pass as extra context data. We tell our UpdateView that its (official) form will be of the class ProfileForm and that its queryset will be a single instance of the Profile model: namely, the users will only be able to update their own profile (hence the get_object override). The additional form that ProfileUpdateView needs to deal with will be of class UserForm and will have self.request.user as its queryset. We also tell ProfileUpdateView that we'll want to refer to this form by user_form in our template. Finally, we need to process the two forms, which means that we need to override UpdateView 's post method. We take our whole POST request and run it through both ProfileForm and UserForm : this means that we let the forms take in the whole of the data, pick what they need (i.e. what corresponds to their fields), and apply it to the relevant objects. If our forms are valid, we can save the information. Otherwise, we reject the input (and re-render everything with relevant error information).

Only logged-in users should be able to edit their profile information, hence the LoginRequiredMixin . UpdateView expects to deal with a single form by default, and every form requires a queryset, and some explicitly-defined fields or form_class . However, we want our UpdateView to deal with two forms: we will pass one form to the view in the way it expects, and the other we will pass as extra context data. We tell our UpdateView that its (official) form will be of the class ProfileForm and that its queryset will be a single instance of the Profile model: namely, the users will only be able to update their own profile (hence the get_object override). The additional form that ProfileUpdateView needs to deal with will be of class UserForm and will have self.request.user as its queryset. We also tell ProfileUpdateView that we'll want to refer to this form by user_form in our template. Finally, we need to process the two forms, which means that we need to override UpdateView 's post method. We take our whole POST request and run it through both ProfileForm and UserForm : this means that we let the forms take in the whole of the data, pick what they need (i.e. what corresponds to their fields), and apply it to the relevant objects. If our forms are valid, we can save the information. Otherwise, we reject the input (and re-render everything with relevant error information).","title":"Views"},{"location":"11_editing_profiles/#templates","text":"In templates/settings.html : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block title %} < title > Settings - Conduit </ title > {% endblock %} {% block content %} < div class = \"settings-page\" > < div class = \"container page\" > < div class = \"row\" > < div class = \"col-md-6 offset-md-3 col-xs-12\" > < h1 class = \"text-xs-center\" > Your Settings </ h1 > < form method = \"post\" > {% csrf_token %} < fieldset > < fieldset class = \"form-group\" > < input class = \"form-control\" type = \"text\" placeholder = \"URL of profile picture\" name = \"{{ form.image.name }}\" value = \"{{ form.image.value|default_if_none:'' }}\" /> </ fieldset > {{ form.image.errors }} < fieldset class = \"form-group\" > < input class = \"form-control form-control-lg\" type = \"text\" required placeholder = \"Username\" name = \"{{ user_form.username.name }}\" value = \"{{ user_form.username.value|default_if_none:'' }}\" /> </ fieldset > {{ user_form.username.errors }} < fieldset class = \"form-group\" > < textarea class = \"form-control form-control-lg\" rows = \"8\" placeholder = \"Short bio about you\" name = \"{{ form.bio.name }}\" > {{ form.bio.value|default_if_none:'' }} </ textarea > </ fieldset > {{ form.bio.errors }} < fieldset class = \"form-group\" > < input class = \"form-control form-control-lg\" type = \"email\" placeholder = \"Email\" required name = \"{{ user_form.email.name }}\" value = \"{{ user_form.email.value|default_if_none:'' }}\" /> </ fieldset > {{ user_form.email.errors }} < fieldset class = \"form-group\" > < input class = \"form-control form-control-lg\" type = \"password\" placeholder = \"New Password\" name = \"{{ user_form.new_password.name }}\" /> </ fieldset > {{ user_form.new_password.errors }} < button class = \"btn btn-lg btn-primary pull-xs-right\" type = \"submit\" > Update Settings </ button > </ fieldset > </ form > < hr /> < a href = \"{% url 'logout' %}\" class = \"btn btn-outline-danger\" > Or click here to logout. </ a > </ div > </ div > </ div > </ div > {% endblock %} The template is quite simple, for a change: we refer to the ProfileUpdateView 's main form by form , and to the additional form by user_form .
