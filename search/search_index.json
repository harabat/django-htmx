We could do this like in the Django Girls tutorial: the ArticleDetailView would include a button that would direct to CommentCreateView on a separate page, and saving the comment would bring the user back to the ArticleDetailView . However, the RealWorldApp allows users to create and save their comments directly below the article, on the same page, so that's what we're going to try. Surprisingly, this is not straightforward to implement in Django, because it implies mixing DetailView and CreateView functionalities in a single page, which is made difficult by the fact that the DetailView doesn't have a POST method, while the CreateView requires it. Fortunately, our use case is covered in the Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/class-based-views/mixins/#an-alternative-better-solution . First, we'll create a CommentCreateView in users/views.py . We override the form_valid method because we need to specify the author and article fields required by the Comment model.

In urls.py , we replace the article_detail path by the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 # other imports from .views import ( # other views ArticleCommentView , ) urlpatterns = [ # other paths path ( \"article/<slug:slug>\" , ArticleCommentView . as_view (), name = \"article_detail\" , ), # instead of =path(\"article/<slug:slug>\", ArticleCommentView.as_view(), name=\"article_detail\")= ] Now that our views.py and urls.py are ready, we need to create the templates.

That is, we want to allow users to update 2 models at the same URL. Surprisingly, this common use case is not straightforward to implement with Django, especially if we're trying to follow good practice and use class-based views. Take a break before continuing, as we're going to go into the weeds here. Cool, let's recap what we're doing. We have two models ( User and Profile ), which happen to be related with a OneToOneField . We want to update these models in one place. Intuitively, we'll reach for the UpdateView . The problem is that UpdateView expects a single model. The solution is to tell our UpdateView to deal with two forms. Forms # Let's create users/forms.py and define two forms, one for each model: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 from django import forms from .models import Profile , User class ProfileForm ( forms . ModelForm ): class Meta : model = Profile fields = [ \"image\" , \"bio\" ] class UserForm ( forms . ModelForm ): new_password = forms . CharField ( required = False ) class Meta : model = User fields = [ \"username\" , \"email\" , \"new_password\" ] def save ( self , commit = True ): user = super () . save ( commit = False ) new_password = self . cleaned_data . get ( \"new_password\" ) if new_password : user . set_password ( new_password ) user . save () return user ModelForm allows to get a lot of model-relevant form logic for free (Django's \u201cbatteries included\u201d philosophy). The ProfileForm is self-explanatory. The UserForm is a bit more complicated. Let's go through it in detail. We want to our user to be able to update three types of information: the username, the email, and the password. We also want to expose the current username and email values in the template, but we don't want to expose any information about the password. The screenshot below clarifies what we mean here: the screenshot on the right could leak information about the number of characters in our user's password, even though the characters themselves are masked, while the screenshot on the right exposes no information about the password. Password field with masked characters Empty password field We want the password field in our future template to be empty, and we don't want to force the user to type it out every time they want to modify some other information. In other words, we want the password field to be optional, ie required=False . Furthermore, since this password field doesn't need any information about the current password, we can just create a dummy new_password field, instead of linking our form to the User model's actual password attribute. Finally, when we save the form, we only want to update the password if the user has actually changed it on the form, so we need to override the form's save method. Also, because Django saves hashes of passwords, instead of the raw password strings, in its database, we need to use the User object's set_password method, which takes care of the password hashing. Views # Now that our forms are ready, let's create the view. As we said earlier, the intuitive choice here is the generic UpdateView class-based view. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # other imports from django.views.generic import CreateView , DetailView , UpdateView from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin # other classes class ProfileUpdateView ( LoginRequiredMixin , UpdateView ): form_class = ProfileForm template_name = \"settings.html\" success_url = reverse_lazy ( \"settings\" ) def get_object ( self , queryset = None ): return self . request . user . profile def get_context_data ( self , ** kwargs ): context = super () . get_context_data ( ** kwargs ) context [ \"user_form\" ] = UserForm ( instance = self . request . user ) return context def post ( self , request , * args , ** kwargs ): profile_form = self . form_class ( request . POST , instance = request . user . profile ) user_form = UserForm ( request . POST , instance = request . user ) if profile_form . is_valid () and user_form . is_valid (): profile_form . save () user_form . save () return redirect ( self . success_url ) return super () . post ( request , * args , ** kwargs ) Again, this is a significant amount of code, so let's go through it slowly. Only logged-in users should be able to edit their profile information, hence the LoginRequiredMixin . UpdateView expects to deal with a single form by default, and every form requires a queryset, and some explicitly-defined fields or form_class . However, we want our UpdateView to deal with 2 forms: we will pass one form to the view in the way it expects, and the other we will pass as extra context data. We tell our UpdateView that its (official) form will be of the class ProfileForm and that its queryset will be a single instance of the Profile model: namely, the users will only be able to update their own profile (hence the get_object override). The additional form that ProfileUpdateView needs to deal with will be of class UserForm and will have self.request.user as its queryset. We also tell ProfileUpdateView that we'll want to refer to this form by user_form in our template. Finally, we need to process the two forms, which means that we need to override UpdateView 's post method.

That is, we want to allow users to update 2 models at the same URL. Surprisingly, this common use case is not straightforward to implement with Django, especially if we're trying to follow good practice and use class-based views. Take a break before continuing, as we're going to go into the weeds here. Cool, let's recap what we're doing. We have two models ( User and Profile ), which happen to be related with a OneToOneField . We want to update these models in one place. Intuitively, we'll reach for the UpdateView . The problem is that UpdateView expects a single model. The solution is to tell our UpdateView to deal with two forms.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"10_editing_profiles/#forms","text":"Let's create users/forms.py and define two forms, one for each model: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 from django import forms from .models import Profile , User class ProfileForm ( forms . ModelForm ): class Meta : model = Profile fields = [ \"image\" , \"bio\" ] class UserForm ( forms . ModelForm ): new_password = forms . CharField ( required = False ) class Meta : model = User fields = [ \"username\" , \"email\" , \"new_password\" ] def save ( self , commit = True ): user = super () . save ( commit = False ) new_password = self . cleaned_data . get ( \"new_password\" ) if new_password : user . set_password ( new_password ) user . save () return user ModelForm allows to get a lot of model-relevant form logic for free (Django's \u201cbatteries included\u201d philosophy). The ProfileForm is self-explanatory. The UserForm is a bit more complicated. Let's go through it in detail. We want to our user to be able to update three types of information: the username, the email, and the password. We also want to expose the current username and email values in the template, but we don't want to expose any information about the password. The screenshot below clarifies what we mean here: the screenshot on the right could leak information about the number of characters in our user's password, even though the characters themselves are masked, while the screenshot on the right exposes no information about the password. Password field with masked characters Empty password field We want the password field in our future template to be empty, and we don't want to force the user to type it out every time they want to modify some other information. In other words, we want the password field to be optional, ie required=False . Furthermore, since this password field doesn't need any information about the current password, we can just create a dummy new_password field, instead of linking our form to the User model's actual password attribute. Finally, when we save the form, we only want to update the password if the user has actually changed it on the form, so we need to override the form's save method. Also, because Django saves hashes of passwords, instead of the raw password strings, in its database, we need to use the User object's set_password method, which takes care of the password hashing.","title":"Forms"},{"location":"10_editing_profiles/#views","text":"Now that our forms are ready, let's create the view. As we said earlier, the intuitive choice here is the generic UpdateView class-based view. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # other imports from django.views.generic import CreateView , DetailView , UpdateView from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin # other classes class ProfileUpdateView ( LoginRequiredMixin , UpdateView ): form_class = ProfileForm template_name = \"settings.html\" success_url = reverse_lazy ( \"settings\" ) def get_object ( self , queryset = None ): return self . request . user . profile def get_context_data ( self , ** kwargs ): context = super () . get_context_data ( ** kwargs ) context [ \"user_form\" ] = UserForm ( instance = self . request . user ) return context def post ( self , request , * args , ** kwargs ): profile_form = self . form_class ( request .

POST , instance = request . user ) if profile_form . is_valid () and user_form . is_valid (): profile_form . save () user_form . save () return redirect ( self . success_url ) return super () . post ( request , * args , ** kwargs ) Again, this is a significant amount of code, so let's go through it slowly. Only logged-in users should be able to edit their profile information, hence the LoginRequiredMixin . UpdateView expects to deal with a single form by default, and every form requires a queryset, and some explicitly-defined fields or form_class . However, we want our UpdateView to deal with 2 forms: we will pass one form to the view in the way it expects, and the other we will pass as extra context data. We tell our UpdateView that its (official) form will be of the class ProfileForm and that its queryset will be a single instance of the Profile model: namely, the users will only be able to update their own profile (hence the get_object override). The additional form that ProfileUpdateView needs to deal with will be of class UserForm and will have self.request.user as its queryset. We also tell ProfileUpdateView that we'll want to refer to this form by user_form in our template. Finally, we need to process the two forms, which means that we need to override UpdateView 's post method. We take our whole POST request and run it through both ProfileForm and UserForm : this means that we let the forms take in the whole of the data, pick what they need (ie what corresponds to their fields), and apply it to the relevant objects.
